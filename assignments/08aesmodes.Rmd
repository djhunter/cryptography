## Assignment: due Monday, 11:59 pm

1. Use your `multGF256` function to calculate $x, x^2, x^3, \ldots$ until the answers start repeating. (Observe that they must start repeating eventually because this is a finite field.) How many different "powers of $x$" are there in $\mbox{GF}(256)$?

(I'm assuming you'll do problems 2--4 by hand; no additional programming is expected.)

2. Define an encryption function on 4-bit blocks by representing 4-digit bit strings as polynomials in the field $\mathbb{Z}_2[x]/(p(x))$, where $p(x) = x^4+x^3+x^2+x+1$, and defining $E(p(x)) = x^2 p(x)$. **Encrypt** the 3-block string $001101010011$ using this cipher in ECB mode. In addition, give a formula for the decryption function.

3. Define an encryption function on 4-bit blocks by representing 4-digit bit strings as polynomials in the field of Problem 2, and defining $E(p(x)) = x^2 p(x)$. Encrypt the 3-block string $001101010011$ using this cipher in CBC mode, with an initial vector of $1011$. 

4. Define an encryption function on 4-bit blocks by representing 4-digit bit strings as polynomials in the field of Problem 2, and defining $E(p(x)) = x^2 p(x)$. Encrypt the 3-block string $001101010011$ using this cipher in CTR mode, with an initial vector of $1011$. (For the purposes of this problem, replace $L_8$ with the identity function.) Show all work. (Warning: The counter in CTR mode uses binary addition, while the $\oplus$ operation corresponds to addition in the field (which works like an XOR). These are different operations. For example, in this problem, $X_1 = 1011$, so when incremented by the counter, $X_2 = X_1 + 1 = 1011+1=1100$. As elements of the field, these bit strings correspond to $X_1 = x^3+x+1$ and $X_2 = x^3+x^2$, so in the field, $X_2 \neq X_1 + 1$.)
