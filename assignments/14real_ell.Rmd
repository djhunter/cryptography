Upload to Canvas a PDF of your work for the following problems. Note that 2 and 3 ask you to include plots generated by R.

## Assignment: due Monday, 11:59 pm

1. Denote $(\infty, \infty)$ by $\infty$. Find a point $P \neq \infty$ on the real elliptic curve $y^2 = x^3-10x+24$ such that $2P = \infty$. Explain how you know that your answer is correct. (In this situation, we say that "$P$ has order 2."  Note that $P$ is the additive analog of a square root of 1.) Hint: Use the provided `ecPlotReal` to see what this curve looks like.

2. Consider the point $P = (2,1)$ on the real elliptic curve $y^2=x^3-3x-1$. Use `ecPlotReal` to plot this curve, along with the points $nP$ for $n=1,2,\ldots,100$. Is there a pattern? (The code block below shows how to use `points` to add points to a plot. The first point is plotted for you.) Note that the points $nP$ are called "powers" of $P$, because this group uses additive notation.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ecPlotReal(-3,-1)
nPpts <- matrix(numeric(200), ncol = 2) # preallocate points for nP
nPpts[1,] <- c(2,1) # the first point P
# TODO: calculate the other 99 points (use your package functions)
points(nPpts)
```

3. Instead of adding points to the plot in the previous problem, we can add lines connecting successive powers of $P$ by replacing the `points` command with the `lines` command. Try it. Experiment with some different choices of elliptic curve and initial point $P$ and include a plot that you like. What seems to be true about the distribution of successive powers of $P$?
