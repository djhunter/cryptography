#' Count the occurrence of each letter in a string
#'
#' This function counts how many times each letter occurs in a string and presents in a table.
#'
#' @param txt String (assumed to contain only lowercase letters)
#'
#' @return A table of letter counts, sorted by decreasing count

#' Count digrams in a string
#'
#' This function counts how many times each digram (two successive letters) occurs in a string.
#'
#' @param txt String (assumed to contain only lowercase letters)
#'
#' @return A table with the numbers of digrams of each possible type

#' Encrypt a string using a Vigenere cipher
#'
#' This function implements the Vigenere cipher. Each letter of the  
#' plaintext is shifted by the corresponding value of the repeated key vector.

#' @param txt String to be encrypted (assumed to contain only lowercase letters)
#' @param keyVector Vector of integers (mod 26) to shift by
#'
#' @return An encrypted string

#'
#' This function shifts the elements of a vector n positions to
#' the right, with the end wrapping around to the beginning.
#'
#' @param v Vector to be shifted
#' @param n Number of positions to shift the vector
#'
#' @return The shifted vector

#' Find characters in positions n, n+r, n+2r, n+3r, etc
#'
#' Given a string, this function returns a new string comprising the 
#' characters in positions n, n+r, n+2r, n+3r, etc.
#'
#' @param txt A string
#' @param n Position of the first character
#' @param r Relative position of each subsequent character
#'

#' Compute the relative frequency of letters in a string
#'
#' This function computes the relative frequency each letter occurs 
#' in a string of lower case letters.
#'
#' @param txt String (assumed to contain only lowercase letters)
#'
#' @return A vector of letter frequency, in order of lower case English letters.

#' Find the Vigenere key
#'
#' This function consumes a ciphertext string `ciphertext` and a key 
#' length `keyLength`, and returns the key that produced the ciphertext, 
#' assuming that the ciphertext was produced using a VigenÃ¨re cipher with 
#' key length `keyLength`.
#'
#' @param ciphertext String (assumed to contain only lowercase letters)
#' @param keylength The length of the key
