# Substitution Ciphers

## Recall: Ciphers

> A **cipher** is an algorithm that inputs a plaintext string and outputs a ciphertext string, according to some given key.

Mathematically, a cipher is a one-to-one and onto function on the alphabet set $X$.

$$
c : X \longrightarrow X
$$

## Shift and Affine Ciphers

Suppose that a plaintext message is composed from an alphabet set $X$. If $c : X \longrightarrow X$ is a one-to-one correspondence, then $c$ defines a cipher that can be applied to the plaintext. Such a cipher is a **substitution cipher.**

Examples:

- Shift cipher
- Affine cipher

## Brute force attacks

The time required for a brute force attack (trying all the keys) is proportional to the number of possible keys. 

> *Warm-up question:* How many different keys are there for the following ciphers on $\mathbb{Z}_{26}$?
>
> a. The shift cipher $x \mapsto x+h$, where $h$ is a chosen element of $\mathbb{Z}_{26}$.
> b. The affine cipher $x \mapsto \alpha x + \beta$, where $\alpha, \beta$ are chosen elements of $\mathbb{Z}_{26}$.
> c. A general substitution cipher $x \mapsto \sigma(x)$, where $\sigma$ is a chosen permutation of the elements of $\mathbb{Z}_{26}$.

## Letter-frequency attacks {.smaller}

A **frequency analysis attack** exploits the fact that, in any natural language, some letters are used more than others. For example, in English, the frequencies of each letter are as follows.

```{r}
englishFreqs <- c(0.082,0.015,0.028,0.043,0.127,0.022,0.020,0.061,0.070, 0.002,0.008,0.040,0.024,
                  0.067,0.075,0.019,0.001,0.060,0.063,0.091,0.028,0.010,0.023,0.001,0.020,0.001)
names(englishFreqs) <- letters
sort(englishFreqs,decreasing=TRUE)
```

## Example

```{r subexamplesetup, include=FALSE}
scramble <- function(txt, perm) {
  l <- unlist(strsplit(txt,""))
  k <- letters[perm]
  names(k) <- letters
  scramList <- k[l]
  return(paste0(scramList,collapse=""))
}
plaintext <- "howeverinthisextremedistresshewasnotdestituteofhisusualsagacitybuttrustinghimselftotheprovidenceofgodheputhislifeintohazardinthemannerfollowingandnowsaidhesinceitisresolvedamongyouthatyouwilldiecomeonletuscommitourmutualdeathstodeterminationbylothewhomthelotfallstofirstlethimbekilledbyhimthathaththesecondlotandthusfortuneshallmakeitsprogressthroughusallnorshallanyofusperishbyhisownrighthandforitwouldbeunfairifwhentherestaregonesomebodyshouldrepentandsavehimselfthisproposalappearedtothemtobeveryjustandwhenhehadprevailedwiththemtodeterminethismatterbylotshedrewoneofthelotsforhimselfalsohewhohadthefirstlotlaidhisneckbaretohimthathadthenextassupposingthatthegeneralwoulddieamongthemimmediatelyfortheythoughtdeathifjosephusmightbutdiewiththemwassweeterthanlifeyetwashewithanotherlefttothelastwhetherwemustsayithappenedsobychanceorwhetherbytheprovidenceofgodandashewasverydesirousneithertobecondemnedbythelotnorifhehadbeenlefttothelasttoimbruehisrighthandinthebloodofhiscountrymenhepersuadedhimtotrusthisfidelitytohimandtoliveaswellashimself"
testKey <- c(22,3,10,12,8,1,21,18,24,25,4,13,19,5,23,16,7,11,9,2,15,20,17,14,26,6)
ciphertext <- scramble(plaintext, testKey)
```

Suppose that the following ciphertext is the result of a substitution cipher:

```{r, tidy=TRUE, tidy.opts=list(width.cutoff=60)}
ciphertext
```

## Count the letters

```{r}
letterCounts <- function(txt)
{
  return(sort(table(unlist(strsplit(txt,""))),decreasing=TRUE))
}
letterCounts(ciphertext)
```

Assuming that the plaintext is in English, what do you conclude?

## Make some substitutions {.build}

```{r}
dct <- gsub("h","E",ciphertext)
dct <- gsub("b","T",dct)
dct
```


## Look at digrams 

```{r}
digramTable <- function(txt)
  # returns a table with the numbers of digrams of each possible type
{
  l <- unlist(strsplit(txt,""))
  dgs <- data.frame(l,c(l[2:length(l)],NA))
  names(dgs) <- c("first","second")
  table(dgs)
}
```

The most common digrams in English are TH HE IN ER AN RE ED ON ES. 

## {.smaller}
```{r}
digramTable(ciphertext)
```

## Make more substitutions based on digrams

```{r}
dct <- gsub("r", "H", dct)
dct <- gsub("k", "R", dct)
dct
```

## Make more substitutions *ad hoc*

See R console.

## Check your answer; see the key

```{r, eval=FALSE}
letterCounts(ciphertext)
letterCounts(dct)
```

## Types of Attack

A letter-frequency analysis is a *Ciphertext only* attack.

- Ciphertext only attacks are always possible, because the ciphertext is what gets sent over public channels.
- *Known plaintext:* If you have the plaintext and the ciphertext, how could you obtain the key?
- *Chosen plaintext/ciphertext* attack:
    - If you got access to the encryption (or decryption) machine for a substitution cipher, how could you obtain the key?

# The Vigenère cipher

## Passphrase encryption

Some systems, like [PassPack](https://passpack.com), encrypt data using a key based on a **passphrase** you provide. They don't store the key/passphrase; they only store the encrypted data, so if you forget your passphrase you are out of luck. 

## Vigenère cipher

In 1553, Giovan Battista Bellaso published a [paper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovan_Battista_Bellaso#/media/File:Bellaso_foreword.jpg) describing a passphrase-based encryption method.

The system was later attributed (falsely) to Blaise de Vigenère, so that's what everyone calls it now.

## How the Vigenère cipher works {.build}

The key is a passphrase, usually consisting of a word or two. For example, `mypassphrase`.

To encrypt, you line up the letters of the plaintext with repeated copies of the passphrase and add (mod 26).

```
thisistheplaintextthatwewouldliketoencryptusingthevigenerecipher
mypassphrasemypassphrasemypassphrasemypassphrasemypassphrasemypassphrase
```

`t` corresponds to 19, `m` corresponds to 12, so the first letter of ciphertext corresponds to $(19+12) \bmod 26 = 5$, i.e., `f`

## Discuss: Think/group/share:

1. How would you decrypt the Vigenère cipher, given the key?
2. Is the Vigenère cipher a substitution cipher? Why or why not?

Step 1: Take a moment to just **think** about the answers to these questions.

## Discuss at your tables

1. How would you decrypt the Vigenère cipher, given the key?
2. Is the Vigenère cipher a substitution cipher? Why or why not?

Step 2: Discuss the answers in your table **groups**. 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(knitr)
roster <- c("Sam", "Wesley", "Andrew", "Winston", "Michael", "Logan", "Christian", "Caleb", "James", "Joe", "Emily", "Giselle", "Nathan")
set.seed(982020) 
n <- length(roster)
ngps <- 3
maxingp <- ceiling(n/ngps)
# just make random groups
groups <- matrix(c(roster[sample(n)], 
                   rep("",(maxingp - (n %% maxingp)) %% maxingp)), 
                 ncol=maxingp, byrow=FALSE)
rownames(groups) <- paste0("Table #", 1:nrow(groups))
kable(t(groups))
```

## Discuss as a large group

1. How would you decrypt the Vigenère cipher, given the key?
2. Is the Vigenère cipher a substitution cipher? Why or why not?

Step 3: **Share** what we discussed in a large group.

## Vigenère cipher in math 

Passphrase: A vector $\mathbf{v} = (k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_n) \in \mathbb{Z}_{26}^n$.

Plaintext: a vector $\mathbf{p} \in \mathbb{Z}_{26}^{N}$, where $N$ is the number of characters in the plaintext.

For simplicity, assume that $N=nk$ for some $k$. We could then break the plaintext $\mathbf{p}$ into **blocks** $\mathbf{p}_1, \mathbf{p}_2, \ldots, \mathbf{p}_k$, where each of these blocks $\mathbf{p}_i$ is in $\mathbb{Z}_{26}^n$. 

Then the encryption process is represented by a function $\mathbb{Z}_{26}^{n} \longrightarrow \mathbb{Z}_{26}^{n}$, given by
$$
\mathbf{p}_i \longmapsto \mathbf{p}_i + \mathbf{v}
$$
where the addition is componentwise, modulo 26.

## Terminology {.build}

> A cipher is called **symmetric** if it uses the same key to encrypt as to decrypt.

All of the ciphers we have seen so far are symmetric.

> A **block cipher** is a cipher algorithm that operates on fixed-length sections, or **blocks** of plaintext. 

The Vigenère cipher is an example of a symmetric block cipher. So are DES and AES. 

## Vigenère cipher in code

```{r}
stringToMod26 <- function(x) {utf8ToInt(x)-utf8ToInt("a")}
mod26ToString <- function(x) {intToUtf8(x+utf8ToInt("a"))}

vigenere <- function(txt, keyVector)
{
  pt <- stringToMod26(txt)
  suppressWarnings( 
    ct <- (pt + keyVector) %% 26
  )                               
  return(mod26ToString(ct))
}

plaintext <- "thisistheplaintextthatwewouldliketoencryptusingthevigenerecipher"
keyAsVector <- stringToMod26("mypassphrase")
vigenere(plaintext, keyAsVector)
```
