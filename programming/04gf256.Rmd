## Assignment: due Sunday, 11:59 pm

Add the file [`gf256.R`](https://djhunter.github.io/cryptography/R/gf256.R) to the `R` subdirectory of your project. Note that we are using the representation $\mbox{GF}(2^8) = \mathbb{Z}_2[x]/(x^8+x^4+x^3+x+1)$.

1. Implement the function `addGF256`.

2. Implement the function `multByXinGF256`. This helper function will need to take into account the polynomial modulus.

3.  Implement the function `multGF256`. (Make use of the previous two functions.)
