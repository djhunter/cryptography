## Assignment: due Sunday, 11:59 pm

1.  Add the file [`gf256.R`](https://djhunter.github.io/cryptography/R/gf256.R) to the `R` subdirectory of your project. Implement the functions `multByXinGF256` and `multGF256` as specified in the documentation. Note that we are using the representation $\mbox{GF}(2^8) = \mathbb{Z}_2[x]/(x^8+x^4+x^3+x+1)$.

2. Install the `digest` package.  Add the file [`aestools.R`](https://djhunter.github.io/cryptography/R/aestools.R) to the `R` subdirectory of your project. This file `@import`s the `digest` package, so it needs to be installed first. Implement the function `bfkpAESattack` as specified in the documentation.
