## Assignment: due Sunday, 11:59 pm

Add the file [`hash.R`](https://djhunter.github.io/cryptography/R/dlhash.R) to the `R` subdirectory of your project. 

0. This file includes a function `miniSHA` that imports the `openssl` package (which you need to install if you haven't already.) Unfortunately, there is a naming collision with the `digest` package that produces annoying warning messages. To make these messages go away, we need to fix `aestools.R` so that it only imports the function `AES` and not any other functions. To do this, change the line in `aestools.R` from
```{r, eval=FALSE}
#' @import digest
```
to
```{r, eval=FALSE}
#' @importFrom digest AES
```

1. Implement `birthdayAttack` as specified. There is some advice in the slides about using the `duplicated` function.
